            <h3>General</h3>
            <ion-list>
                <p>
                   Any person who changes his/her civil status (from single to married) is required to update his/her record with the civil registry by applying an NSO Marriage Certificate.  Moreover, a change in status will also require an updating of one’s personal data which is necessary in applying for a passport, SSS or GSIS benefits, birth certificate of one’s child/children, PRC license, driver’s license, and other official documents issued by the government. Private companies also require their employees to update their personal data especially their civil status should they get married before they can avail of any benefits accorded by the company. Changing one’s status will necessarily result in the change of names of women, thus, it is imperative for them to submit a Marriage Certificate.
