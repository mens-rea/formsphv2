                           An NBI Clearance is one of the required documents for job application in the Philippines. In some cases, an NBI Clearance is also necessary to apply for a visa to travel to another country or to apply for employment overseas. The application process can sometimes be a hassle especially for first timers who do not have an idea how long they have to wait before their clearance can be processed and eventually issued. Normally, hundreds of people wait in line every day from as early as 6:30 am until 3 pm before they can complete all the necessary procedures to secure their clearance. Although the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has already set up satellite offices that process Clearance applications, the volume of people that usually turns up can make the procedure long and arduous.

The fee will depend on the purpose of your application.
